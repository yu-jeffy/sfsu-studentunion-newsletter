# SFSU Student Union Website/Blog

## Running the website locally

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Admin Login Credentials

*If you are hosting on Vercel, skip this step and set them [here](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables). Note you will need the names of the two environment variables, which are below:*

Set the login credentials, which are in the environment variables.

Make a copy of the .env.example file and name it .env. You can use this command or do it manually:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Open the .env file in your text editor.

Replace the placeholder values with your actual values. For example, if your .env.example file looks like this:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_USERNAME=your_username
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password
```

Save the .env file.

### 3. Run the server/website!

Then, run the development server:

```bash
node server.js
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the blog.

## Adding a New Blog Post With "Create" Page

Navigate to `www.linktoblog.com/create`

### Login

Before you can create a post, you need to log in with the admin credentials. These credentials are set in the `.env` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

### Create a Post

After you've logged in, you can create a new post.

1. Enter the post title in the **Title** field.
2. Enter the author's name in the **Author** field.
3. Enter a short summary of the post in the **Excerpt** field.
4. Enter the date of the post in the **Date** field.
5. Enter the post content in the **Content** field. The content field supports Markdown, so you can use Markdown syntax to format your post. For example, you can use `**text**` to make text bold, or `*text*` to make text italic.
6. Click the **Submit** button to create the post.

After you click the **Submit** button, the post will be created and added to the list of posts.

Please note that all fields are required. If you try to submit the form without filling out all fields, an error will be displayed.

If you're new to Markdown, you can find a quick and easy guide [here](https://zapier.com/blog/beginner-ultimate-guide-markdown/).

You can use an online Markdown editor to preview your post [here](https://stackedit.io/app#). You can also write the post in the editor and paste it in to the website.

### Upload Images

You can upload images to use in your post. To upload an image:

1. Click the **Upload** button.
2. Select the image file you want to upload.
3. Click the **Open** button to upload the image.

The image will be uploaded and saved on the server. The name of the uploaded image file will be displayed.

To use the uploaded image in your post, you can reference it by filename in your Markdown content. For example, if you uploaded an image named `image.jpg`, you can include it in your post by adding the following Markdown to your content: 

```markdown
![Image description](/images/image.jpg)
```

This will display the image in your post. The `/images/` prefix is necessary because the images are stored in the images directory on the server.

## Adding a New Blog Post Manually
This guide will walk you through the process of adding a new blog post to the project. The blog post will be written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that you can learn in a few minutes.

### Step 1: Create a New Markdown File
First, you need to create a new Markdown file. For creating and editing your Markdown files, you have the option to work locally on your computer or use an online markdown editor. A recommended online editor is StackEdit, which you can access [here](https://stackedit.io/app#).

If you're new to Markdown, you can find a quick and easy guide [here](https://zapier.com/blog/beginner-ultimate-guide-markdown/).

There is an example post in this repo named `EXAMPLE_POST.md`, you can download it and use this as a template.

### Step 2: Start With Metadata
To start, you need to add metadata to the top of your post. Here's an example, feel free to copy it and change it:
```
---
title: "My First Blog Post"
date: "2023-01-13"
excerpt: "This is the excerpt of my first blog post."
author: "John Doe"
---
```
- Title is the title of the post. 
- Date is the date when the post was written. 
- Format is year-month-day.
- Excerpt is the post snippet that will be shown on the homepage
- Author is the author of the post.

Be sure to start and end it with three dashes, exactly like above.

### Step 3: Write Your Blog Post
Next, you can start writing your blog post in the newly created Markdown file. 

Here is a syntax cheatsheet:

| Style           | Markdown Syntax          | Description                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Paragraph / Line Break           | Blank line            | Separate paragraphs with one or more blank lines       |
| Bold            | `**bold text**`          | Bold text                                |
| Italic          | `*italic text*`          | Italic text                              |
| Bold & Italic   | `***bold & italic***`    | Bold and italic text                     |
| Link            | `[title](https://...)`   | A hyperlink with the given title         |
| Image           | `![alt text](image.jpg)` | An image with alt text                   |
| Strikethrough   | `~~strikethrough~~`      | Strikethrough text                       |
| Unordered List  | `- list item`            | A bullet list item                       |
| Ordered List    | `1. list item`           | A numbered list item                     |
| Blockquote      | `> blockquote`           | A blockquote                             |
| Heading 1       | `# Heading 1`            | The largest heading                      |
| Heading 2       | `## Heading 2`           | The second largest heading               |
| Heading 3       | `### Heading 3`          | The third largest heading                |
| Indent          | `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`     | Indent text by four spaces               |

Another syntax cheatsheet can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). 

### Step 3: Add Images to Your Post
If you want to add images to your blog post, you need to put the image files in the `public/images` folder. To reference an image in your Markdown file, you can use the following syntax:

```
![Alt Text](/images/your-image-file.jpg)
```

Replace `Alt Text` with a brief description of the image (this text shows up if the image doesn't load), and replace `your-image-file.jpg` with the name of your image file.

### Step 5: Save and Check Your Post
After you've finished writing your post and adding metadata, save your Markdown file. Add it to the `blogs` folder. 

The file should have a `.md` extension. For example, if you want to create a blog post titled "My First Post", you might create a file named `my-first-post.md`. 

The title is important, since it will be the URL of the blog post. For example, `my-first-post.md` will be found at `www.example.com/posts/my-first-post`.

### Step 6: All Done!
Your new blog post should now be available on the the website.

Happy blogging! ðŸ™Œ ðŸŽ‰
